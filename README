ObjectLayout is aimed at creating some useful core Java classes that
are designed with optimizable memory layout in mind.

The ObjectLayout*/ directories contain the generic, pure Java
ObjectLayout libraries which should run with any Java VM >= 6.

The hotspot/ directory contains some OpenJDK specific VM optimizations
with the goal to intrinsify and optimize the generic ObjectLayout
library. See hotspot/README for more information.
